This Project is about the EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) Done on a US Accidents Data. In this Project rather than EDA i'hve also taken out some insights which is mentioned at the end of the project and also i hve ask and answered Question about the Analysis. I have performed this data analysis with the help of Python programming in which i have use different libraries such as Pandas seaborn Folium Matplotlib etc. to take out some accurate insights.
